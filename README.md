üì¶ Dockster: Your Smart Document Parser
üìÑ Overview
Dockster is a robust and intelligent document parsing tool designed to streamline the data extraction process from various document types. It efficiently handles both textual content and complex structured data, including tables, even when they are embedded as images within the document.

Dockster turns cumbersome manual data entry into a simple upload-and-download process, providing clean, organized data in instantly usable formats like plain text (.txt) and comma-separated values (.csv).

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-Format Input: Seamlessly process documents from common formats, including Images, PDFs, and Word Documents.

Intelligent Text Extraction: Accurately pulls all primary text content, ensuring comprehensive data capture.

Structured Table Detection (OCR): Advanced capabilities to identify and extract data from structured tables, even those embedded as visual elements or images (using Optical Character Recognition).

Clean Output Formats:

Text Output: Provides all extracted text content in a single, simple .txt file.

Table Output: Converts all detected tables into highly-portable and structured .csv files.

Efficiency: Designed for speed and accuracy, significantly reducing the time spent on manual data extraction.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow: How it Works
The Dockster process is straightforward and focuses on getting you the data you need quickly:

Upload: A user uploads a file (Image, PDF, or Word Document) through the interface.

Parse & Analyze: Dockster processes the document, separating pure text content from structured tabular data.

OCR/Extraction: Advanced algorithms perform text recognition and table structure analysis, specifically targeting tables presented visually.

Organize: All extracted text is compiled, and each detected table is individually processed.

Download: The user receives a single .txt file for the text and one or more separate .csv files for the tabular data.

üöÄ Getting Started (Placeholder)
Currently, the exact installation and setup steps will depend on the chosen implementation (e.g., Python backend, JavaScript frontend).

For a typical setup, you would generally need to:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/dockster.git](https://github.com/yourusername/dockster.git)
cd dockster

Install dependencies (e.g., Python packages for OCR/parsing).

Run the application.

Detailed installation instructions will be added here upon final architectural design.

üöß Future Enhancements
We are continually working to improve Dockster. Planned features include:

Batch Processing: Support for uploading and parsing multiple documents simultaneously.

API Integration: Creating a RESTful API endpoint for programmatic data extraction.

Custom Schema Mapping: Allowing users to define specific output schemas for table data.

Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR): Exploring options for extracting text from handwritten notes within documents.
